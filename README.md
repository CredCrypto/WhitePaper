# WhitePaper
The initial intellectual description and white paper regarding CredCrypto. CredCrypto is more than just another crypto currency; it's philanthropy, security and street cred all rolled into one. With CredCrypto, and appropriate technologies, users of all stripes will be able to earn, trade and give a tangible currency in relation to charitable technological apps, like donating time to open source projects in return for "Cred". In forums and online or offiline communites of all type CredCrypto will be earned, given and used in place of up voting people can actually earn real currency for their time. Of course this depends on good people and a good CredCrypto network which is where we'll need help.

More to come... stay tuned.
