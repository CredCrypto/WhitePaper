# CredCrypto WhitePaper
CredCrypto is more than just another crypto currency; it's philanthropy, security and street cred all rolled into one. With CredCrypto, and appropriate technologies, users of all stripes will be able to earn, trade and give a tangible currency in relation to charitable technological apps; like donating time to open source projects in return for "Cred". In forums and anywhere online or off communites of all types CredCrypto can/will be earned, given and used. In place of up-voting people can actually earn real currency for their time. Of course this depends on good people and a strong CredCrypto network.

More to come... stay tuned.
